1. Docker Compose (Recommended for you)
What it is: Runs Airflow in containers using Docker
Cost: Free and open-source
Pros:

Isolated environment - Won't interfere with your Python setup
Complete setup - Includes webserver, scheduler, metadata database (Postgres), and executor in one configuration
Reproducible - Same setup works on any machine with Docker
Easy cleanup - Delete containers without affecting your system
Production-like - Mirrors real deployments
Official support - Maintained by Apache Airflow team

Cons:

Resource intensive - Uses ~2-4GB RAM (multiple containers running)
Requires Docker - Need Docker Desktop installed
Slower startup - Takes 1-2 minutes to start all services
Learning curve - Need basic Docker knowledge

Best for: Your situation - learning Airflow without polluting your local Python environment

2. Local Install (Standalone)
What it is: Install Airflow directly in your Python environment
Cost: Free and open-source
Pros:

Lightweight - Uses less memory (~500MB-1GB)
Fast startup - Seconds instead of minutes
Simple - Just pip install apache-airflow
Easy debugging - Direct access to logs and processes

Cons:

Environment conflicts - Can clash with your existing Python packages (like your py_env)
Limited services - Uses SQLite by default (not production-ready)
Manual setup - Need to configure each component separately
Harder to clean up - Leaves files scattered across your system
Not production-like - Real deployments use more robust setups

Best for: Quick experimentation or very simple workflows
3. Astro CLI (by Astronomer)
What it is: Astronomer's wrapper around Docker Compose with extra tools
Cost:

CLI is free
Astronomer Cloud platform is paid (but optional - you can use CLI locally for free)

Pros:

Best developer experience - Built specifically for Airflow development
Fast project scaffolding - astro dev init creates complete project structure
Easy testing - Built-in commands for testing DAGs
CI/CD ready - Easier deployment to production later
All Docker Compose benefits - Plus additional tooling

Cons:

Vendor lock-in - Uses Astronomer's conventions
Overkill for learning - More features than you need initially
Same resource usage as Docker Compose
Extra layer - One more tool to learn

Best for: Professional development or if you plan to deploy to Astronomer's platform
